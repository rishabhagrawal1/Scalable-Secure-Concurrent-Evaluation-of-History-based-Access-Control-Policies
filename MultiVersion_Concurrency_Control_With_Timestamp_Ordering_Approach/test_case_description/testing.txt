This is a list of testcases for evaluating based on different rules in policy.                
Below lines contain the testcase and comments to describe the motivation and target rule
We have a total of 6 test cases

1) The first testcase can be run using conf1.json,data1.json and policy1.xml.
   This testcase  evaluates the policy where a single movie with movie Id: mov2 is being watched by multiple subjects and policy dictates a max count of the number of times it is watchable.
   Once max count hits the system rejects any more access request by sending policy evaluation value as false.
   
2)The 2nd case can be run using conf2.json,data2.json and policy2.xml.
	This testcase is similar to the above testcase except that it simulates the condition where the policy is for "--" instead of "++"

3) The 3rd case can be run using conf3.json,data3.json and policy3.xml.
   This causes a flood of multiple acccess to same resource by same subject, since number of workers is limited, this policy will cause a conflict in subject tentative attributes and will restart the requests.
   However all requests are to be granted, but still are restarted as the same attribute("history") is read/updated by all the testcases.
   
4) The 4th case can be run using conf4.json,data4.json and policy4.xml.
	This is using same resource multiple times by same/diferent subjects. This causes a resource conflict and the resource co ordinator indicates a resource conflict and then the later requests are re evaluated.
	
5) The 5th case can be run using conf5.json,data5.json and policy5.xml.
	This is a testcase where request is denied due to conflict of interest, i.e same employee cannot access documentsw of bank A as well as bank B.
	
Apart from above 5 testcases, we have a functionality of pseudo-random testcase geenration.
Using a boolean flag as 4th command line argument with value true activates this functionality, which picks up 100 random testcases based on given current testase file .
These cases are then run to simulate a real distributed system behaviour instead of a pre designed testcase and will showcase multiple features of the system.
